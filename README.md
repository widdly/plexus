# plexus
matrix driven sequencer/keyboard/arpeggiator

plexus is a diy device that interfaces a novation launchpad to a teensy and provides 4 channels of cv/gate output.  

The software running on the teensy implements a 4 channel hybrid sequencer/keyboard/arpeggiator inspired by the monome polygome application.
